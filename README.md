# currency-converter
Currency converter project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

For this project, I used fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a currency converter application. This application will be able to load real time currency conversion rates from a 3rd party API, track and display its values.

Currency rates fetched from Fixer API
